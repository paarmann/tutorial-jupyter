# Jupyter tutorial

This repository contains material and instructions for a Jupyter lab/notebook tutorial. 

## How to run this tutorial

### Install Jupyter lab

Install python 3.x using the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). If you feel comfortable to manage your own python environment and packages, I prefer (on MacOS) brew.sh to install python3, venv for virtual environment and pip to manage packages.

### Get the tutorial 

To get the tutorial materials, clone this repository. 

```
git clone https://github.com/paarmann/tutorial-jupyter.git
```  

### Start Jupyter Lab

Enter the following command in a new terminal window to start JupyterLab.

```
$ jupyter lab
```
